## Concept\
\
Our group decided on an application that would allow people to write up interesting events or "stories" that happened to them or that they witnessed and mark them on the spot. Other users can rate the story or mark it as their favourite. The stories stay pinned using geo-location and as users walk through the location where the events took place they are notified that a story occurred and can then proceed to rate it or ignore it.\
\
## Development\
We gathered and brainstormed several ideas until we came up with the concept(described above) and planned the project according to an UML class diagram. After that we designated tasks according to the group's members characteristics(strengths and weaknesses). We had a great teamwork environment that allowed for excellent communication, organization and execution of goals.\
